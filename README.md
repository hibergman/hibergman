### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mr Henry Bergman, I am a Vascular Surgeon and clinical research fellow in the East of England. I am currently undertaking a PhD at Imperial College London. I am keen to learn how modern computer science techniques can be integrated into the clinical practice of Vascular surgery for direct patient benefit.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on risk prediction and understanding of patient disease experience in chronic limb-threatening ischaemia.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning general software engineering techniques with a focus on natural language processing of electronic patient records and machine learning modelling to classify disease severity and predict clinical outcomes. I have a special interest in creating a clinical decision support system which utilises multidimensional geometrical embedding of demographic, behavioural, clinical and technical patient attributes.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on aspects of computer science which overlap with the practice of medicine and surgery; specifically how natural language processing can bring us closer to the understanding and meaningful analysis of the patient disease experience.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with development of a large scale clinical risk prediction system for peripheral arterial disease - as well and the subsequent packaging and optimisation for clinical use.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the interface of natural language processing with modern vascular surgery
